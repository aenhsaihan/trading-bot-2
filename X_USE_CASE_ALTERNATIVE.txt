Trading application that monitors X accounts for cryptocurrency market intelligence. Users authenticate with their X account, and the application monitors tweets from accounts they follow. The system converts relevant posts into trading notifications with AI summarization and voice alerts. The application focuses on market intelligence, technical analysis, and risk alerts from trusted sources. The application only reads tweets from accounts users explicitly follow, respects user privacy, and does not republish or redistribute X content. All data processing happens locally to help traders make informed decisions based on social sentiment and expert analysis.
