# Core dependencies for centralized exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken)
ccxt==4.4.1  # Pinned to avoid coincurve build dependency on Streamlit Cloud (4.4.0 doesn't exist)
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
streamlit>=1.28.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
pyyaml>=6.0
requests>=2.31.0

# DEX support (web3 works without coincurve)
web3>=6.0.0

# Visualization
plotly>=5.17.0

# Note: For full DEX support with ccxt 4.5+ (includes coincurve for performance),
# see requirements-dex.txt. coincurve requires pkg-config which may not be
# available on Streamlit Cloud. ccxt will fall back to pure Python ECDSA if
# coincurve is not available.
