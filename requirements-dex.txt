# Optional DEX dependencies
# These are only needed for DEX functionality
# Note: coincurve requires pkg-config which may not be available on all platforms
# ccxt will fall back to pure Python ECDSA if coincurve is not available

# For full DEX support with ccxt (includes coincurve for performance):
ccxt>=4.5.0

# For DEX using web3 only (no coincurve needed):
# web3>=6.0.0 is already in requirements.txt
